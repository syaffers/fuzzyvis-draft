# Quick Image Classifier Web Application with Flask, Keras and Bokeh

## Learning Outcomes

- Learn how to quickly build "microservices" in Flask.
- Draw and plot beautiful, web-friendly barcharts with Bokeh.
- Load up pre-trained image classification models using Keras.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu/Debian-flavored Linux
- Your best Python chops! You will also need `pip` along with it.
- `virtualenv` will help a lot as you need lots of custom packages.
- Played around with Keras. We won't be training a model, just using one.

## Motivation

You have just built an awesome convolutional neural network which takes images
and spits out what the object in the image is (to some degree of certainty).
You want to share it with your peers around the world to get some feedback on
how well it is performing while, at the same time, collect training data to
train your model more. While it can be tempting to create a desktop
application, this does not distribute easily. An easy way forward is to create
a quick interface on the internet and share it to your friends.

What? You don't have a model trained already? It's okay, we can use a model I
trained to classify images from an online marketplace into 8 different labels.

## Setting Up your Workspace

Let's begin by making a virtual environment in Python. I will be using Python
2.7 but feel free to use Python 3.5 if you are more familiar. The code is
mainly version-agnostic. In your terminal:

    Terminal window
    ===
    $ mkdir ~/venvs/
    $ virtualenv ~/venvs/fuzzvis
    ... # some output messages
    $ source ~/venvs/fuzzvis/bin/activate
    (fuzzvis) $ which pip
    /home/syafiq/venvs/bin/pip

If you see something similar in your terminal window, you are on the right
track. If not, you might want to install `python-virtualenv`.

Let's also make a project folder to keep all the code in one place. I'm going
to call it Fuzzy Vision, for lack of a better name. In your terminal:

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ mkdir ~/fuzzy-vision
    (fuzzvis) $ cd ~/fuzzy-vision

We will need a project structure as follows, you will need to create those
files and folders yourselves:

    ~/fuzzy-vision/
    |-- server.py
    |-- utils.py
    |-- static
    |   `-- styles
    |       `-- app.css
    `-- templates
        |-- error.html
        |-- home.html
        |-- layout.html
        `-- predict.html




## The Basic Requirements

The web interface is going to need some basic requirements. Let's list a few
to start. We will update this as we go along, if we need to.

### Requirements List

#### Interface
1. [ ] Image upload `<form>` page
2. [ ] Results page
3. [ ] Error page

#### Functionality
1. [ ] Upload and store image
2. [ ] Serve uploaded image
3. [ ] Predict uploaded image into 8 labels
4. [ ] Display predictions of image in a chart
5. [ ] Redirect errors to the error page

Okay, that's pretty basic. Let's run with it for now.

## Microservices with Flask

Flask is a Python microservice framework to build web applications quickly.
It has minimal setup and is akin to Express in NodeJS with (more than) several
things missing. Doesn't mean it's a bad framework, as we will see shortly!

Let's begin by installing Flask into your virtual environment. In your
terminal:

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ pip install Flask==0.12.2
    ... # some output messages


### The Flask "Hello, world!"

We will start with a basic *Hello, World!* application. It's as easy as

    server.py
    ===
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
    def home():
        return "Hello, internet!"

That's it, you're good to go! Flask has some quirky ways to run the web app.
One way is to define in your terminal an environment variable called
`FLASK_APP` and point it to `server.py`. Another way is to have a run block
in `server.py` and just call `python server.py` in your terminal. Just to not
have to do weird things to your computer, let's go with option 2. Add the
following to the bottom of `server.py`.

    server.py
    ===
    ...

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run('127.0.0.1')

Run it with

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ python test.py
    * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)

If you point your browser to the URL, you should see "Hello, internet!"
displayed, in all it's empty, blank glory. Flask runs on port 5000 by defult.
You can change this by adding an extra parameter to `app.run()`. __Note: Flask
requires a restart of the app every time you make updates to the server code
or HTML. If you find that your changes are not appearing, try restarting the
web application.__


### Adding Routes to your App

Let's mock up some routes. We'll need 3:
1. the home page, where the image upload form will be,
2. the results page, where we will show the uploaded image and the predictions,
3. the error page, because things can (and will) go wrong.

In Flask, we use the decorator `app.route()` and pass the route string and
the available methods for that route. For this app, we will `POST` to the home
page route so that any errors for the uploaded image will be displayed and the
user will be returned to the upload form. If everything goes well, we will
redirect the users to the results page where we will perform the prediction
on the uploaded image.

The other pages' routes are just `GET` routes.

Also we will need a HTML page to be rendered. Luckily, Flask has us covered
with its `render_template()` function. We will create the templates later. In
code:

    server.py
    ===
    from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

    app = Flask(__name__)


    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def home():
        if request.method == 'GET':
            # show the upload form
            return render_template('home.html')

        if request.method == 'POST':
            # TODO: Logic to process uploaded images

            passed = True # for now
            if passed:
                return redirect(url_for('predict', filename='test.png'))
            else:
                return redirect(url_for('error'))


    @app.route('/predict/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
    def predict(filename):
        # TODO: Logic to load the uploaded image filename and predict the
        # labels

        return render_template('predict.html')


    @app.errorhandler(500)
    def server_error(error):
        return render_template('error.html'), 500

    ...

Notice that the prediction route has a string between `<>` brackets. This is
to inform the route that it must have a `filename` entered in the URL. So
passing `/predict/` to your browser will render a 404 error. But `/predict/abc`
will pass.

## Templating the Pages

Flask's templating engine is very easy to use too. You can create HTML layouts
with lots of __blocks__ which will encapsulate the inner page contents. We will
use this for all of our 3 pages. First, we define a basic layout, reducing the
need to copy and paste headers and footers into each page template.

    templates/layout.html
    ===
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">
        <title>Fuzzy Vision | Upload and Predict Images</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1><a href='/'>Fuzzy Vision</a></h1>
        {% block body %}{% endblock %}
    </body>
    </html>

Next, we define our home page, with a `<form>` tag to store the image upload
HTML element.

    templates/home.html
    ===
    {% extends 'layout.html' %}
    {% block body %}
    <p>Upload an image and the algorithm will tell you what it is!</p>

    <form action="/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="image" id="image">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    {% endblock %}

![Home page view](images/home.png)

Notice the use of the `{% extends 'layout.html' %}` tag at the beginning of the
file. This is to tell Flask that we are inheriting a parent HTML file called
`layout.html` and replacing the `{% block body %}{% endblock %}` tags with
the HTML we defined in the `templates/home.html` file.

The `<form>` is also coded to have the `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
attribute. This is necessary for image uploading as files are passed as a
separate `POST` variable.

The filename does not have to match the route names in our `server.py`. Let's
create the remaining templates. We will just have placeholder text for now
until we code the actual logic of the predictions. !!! ASIDE !!!

The results page:

    templates/predict.html
    ===
    {% extends 'layout.html' %}
    {% block body %}
    <p>Our algorithm thinks it is a Smartphone!</p>

    {% endblock %}

![Predict page view](images/predict.png)

The error page:

    templates/error.html
    ===
    {% extends 'layout.html' %}
    {% block body %}
    <p>
        Whoops! Something went wrong :(. Let us know what happened:
        <a href="mailto:admin@example.com">send email</a>.
    </p>

    {% endblock %}

![Error page view](images/error.png)

Notice how the `h1` link with "Fuzzy Vision" persists over all the pages
without us explicitly coding it into the templates. The templating engine can
do much more but for now, this is good enough.

---

## Adding the Image Upload Functionality

Let's review our requirements.

### Requirements List

#### Interface
1. [x] Image upload `<form>` page
2. [x] Results page
3. [x] Error page

#### Functionality
1. [ ] Upload and store image
2. [ ] Serve uploaded image
3. [ ] Predict uploaded image into 8 labels
4. [ ] Display predictions of image in a chart
5. [x] Redirect errors to the error page

We should now be ready to start adding key functionality to the web
application. Let's start with the image uploading and storage functionality.
For the sake of ease, we will use a typical filesystem storage. When images are
uploaded, it just gets stored in a folder somewhere on the server (or computer)
hosting the web application. Straight to the code!

    server.py
    ===
    import os
    from flask import Flask, flash, render_template, redirect, request, url_for

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = "supertopsecretprivatekey"

    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def home():
        if request.method == 'GET':
            # show the upload form
            return render_template('home.html')

        if request.method == 'POST':
            # check if a file was passed into the POST request
            if 'image' not in request.files:
                flash('No file was uploaded.')
                return redirect(request.url)

            image_file = request.files['image']

            # if filename is empty, then assume no upload
            if image_file.filename == '':
                flash('No file was uploaded.')
                return redirect(request.url)

            # if the file is "legit"
            if image_file:
                passed = False
                try:
                    filename = image_file.filename
                    filepath = os.path.join('/tmp/fuzzvis/', filename)
                    image_file.save(filepath)
                    passed = True
                except Exception:
                    passed = False

                if passed:
                    return redirect(url_for('predict', filename=filename))
                else:
                    flash('An error occurred, try again.')
                    return redirect(request.url)

    ...

In the updated code, we now have a more meaty `POST` request home route. We
first check if there was an image uploaded at all. If there isn't any, we
redirect the user back to the upload page. Otherwise, we save the the image
into a temporary directory in Linux: `/tmp/fuzzvis/`. If any error occurs
during the upload, just send the users back to the homepage.

We also added a Flask configuration `SECRET_KEY` variable. This is needed as
passing files into a `POST` request generates a new session. For security,
will require a secret key to be defined. This value has to be unique and
ideally hard to guess. For now, we will use a string of characters. We will
also need to create the upload directory for the code to work:

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ mkdir -p /tmp/fuzzvis/

Notice that before the redirects, we use a `flash()` function. This comes from
the Flask API and allows us to generate messages that are rendered once, as
error messages are often displayed. We will need to update our templates for
this to work properly. Since this only happens in the home page, we just need
to update the home template.

    templates/home.html
    ===
    {% extends 'layout.html' %}
    {% block body %}

    {% with messages = get_flashed_messages() %}
    {% if messages %}
    <ul class="flash">
        {% for message in messages %}
        <li>{{ message }}</li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% endif %}
    {% endwith %}

    <p>Upload an image and the algorithm will tell you what it is!</p>

    <form action="/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="image" id="image">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    {% endblock %}

Flash messages come in lists, hence why there is a `for` iterator. You can
style this however you wish, however, for the purposes of this tutorial, we
will just focus on functionality. !!! ASIDE !!!

You should test the image uploading functionality now and see if images are
making its way into the filesystem. To do this, just restart the app and upload
a file on the browser. You should land on the predict route with the template
rendering. Now try uploading an empty file, you should end up back at the home
page with an error message.

![Flash error listed above upload form](images/noupload.png)

---

## Adding the Image Serving Functionality

Now that the images are uploaded, we can should be able to serve back the
images. You can aapproach this in many ways but the easiest (and simplest) way
is to just serve an image as is and use that route in other pages in an `<img>`
source attribute. Let's create that route.

    server.py
    ===
    from flask import Flask, flash, render_template, redirect, request, send_file, url_for
    ...

    @app.route('/images/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
    def images(filename):
        return send_file(os.path.join('/tmp/fuzzvis/', filename))

The `send_file()` function from the Flask API allows us to do more than just
serve images, but other files too! All we need to provide is the absolute path
of the uploded file in the server's filesystem. In the browser, we only need to
pass the filename to the URL. You should now test to see that this works in
your browser window. Upload an image, make sure that it works and point your
browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/images/<uploaded_image_filename>`. You should
get the image that you uploaded.

---

## Checkpoint! Refactoring for Redundancy and Security

We should start thinking about our code so far: it seems that there are
redundancies that we can refactor and security measures we should take.

First, we have use the `/tmp/fuzzvis/` path twice. First to store the images,
and second, to serve the images. If and when this path changes, we are likely
to change a whole bunch of paths everywhere. In production, you might also want
to keep a persistent storage (unlike `/tmp/*` which will disappear when the
computer turns off). Instead, we should keep it as a global variable in
`server.py`. Better still: we should keep it as an environment variable so that
users who find our code are not aware of our server filesystem structure.
Coding that in `server.py`:

    server.py
    ===
    import os
    from flask import Flask, flash, render_template, redirect, request, send_file, url_for

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = "supertopsecretprivatekey"
    app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = os.environ['UPLOAD_FOLDER']

    ...

    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def home():
        ... # truncated part of the function
            if image_file:
                passed = False
                try:
                    filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
                    image_file.save(filepath)
                    passed = True
                except Exception:
                    passed = False

        ... # remainder of code
    ...

    @app.route('/images/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
    def images(filename):
        return send_file(os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename))

If you try to run now, you should get a `KeyError`. This is because we have not
set the `UPLOAD_FOLDER` environment variable in our system. Let's update our
environment variables temporarily in the terminal to get the server working
again.

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ export UPLOAD_FOLDER="/tmp/fuzzvis"

This is a temporary change to the environment variables; the variables will
be unset when you close the terminal window. For a persistent environment
variable, edit your `.bash_profile` or `/etc/environment` file. A log out and
log back in may be required for this function properly. You can always check
if environment variables are set or not by typing `$ echo $UPLOAD_FOLDER` and
checking that it matches what you want. You should refer to this [environment
variables guide][7] for more information. !!!ASIDE!!!

You should do the same for the secret key. Again, this value should be hard to
guess in production. For now we can just copy the value to the environment
vriable in the terminal. __Note: do not close your terminal window or you will
need to type in the variables again!__

    server.py
    ===
    import os
    from flask import Flask, flash, render_template, redirect, request, send_file, url_for

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
    app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'] = os.environ['UPLOAD_FOLDER']

    ...

Let's update our environment variables temporarily in the terminal.

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ export SECRET_KEY="supertopsecretprivatekey"

Great, that looks much cleaner and reusable. Next, we should rethink the file
uploading scheme. It seems that our uploader is open to any and all kinds of
files. To limit this, we can define a list of file extensions that are allowed
and check filenames that pass through. To save on disk space, we should limit
the number of files that can be stored in the filesystem. At the same time, we
want to keep as many files as possible so users can go back to their URLs for
a short time. My suggestion: rename all uploaded files into a three-character
alphanumeric filename. This is good because there can be 36 possible characters
(26 alphabetic characters and 10 numeric characters) for 3 character slots
making a total of 36 ^ 3 = 46656 possible choices of filenames. This is big
enough to be persistent enough (not really) and also capping our disk space
usage.

First, we need to create function that will check for the allowed extensions
for our web application. Let's allow typical image extensions like `jpeg`,
`jpg`, `png`, `gif` and `bmp`. Here is the function written out.

    server.py
    ===
    ...

    ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = set(['png', 'bmp', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'])

    def is_allowed_file(filename):
        """ Checks if a filename's extension is acceptable """
        allowed_ext = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS
        return '.' in filename and allowed_ext

    ...

You should keep the constants (i.e. variables with `CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE`) at the
beginning of the file. This is the convention and it's easier to update in the
future. Non-route functions should also come before the route functions.
!!! ASIDE !!!

Now, we can  write a function that will generate the filenames. We need to keep
the original extensions of the uploaded file so let's pass the uploaded
filename as an argument. To make it a more secure, we will use a utility
function `secure_filename()` from `werkzeug.utils`. You can never be too sure
what happens ;).

    server.py
    ===
    import random
    from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

    ...

    LETTER_SET = list(set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'))

    def generate_random_name(filename):
        """ Generate a random name for an uploaded file. """
        ext = filename.split('.')[-1]
        rns = [random.randint(0, len(LETTER_SET) - 1) for _ in range(3)]
        chars = ''.join([LETTER_SET[rn] for rn in rns])

        new_name = "{new_fn}.{ext}".format(new_fn=chars, ext=ext)
        new_name = secure_filename(new_name)

        return new_name
    ...

Now, we can use these functions to check for bogus filenames and also create
filenames when a user uploads a file.

    server.py
    ===
    ...

    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def home():
        ... # truncated part of the function
            if image_file and is_allowed_file(image_file.filename):
                passed = False
                try:
                    filename = generate_random_name(image_file.filename)
                    filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
                    image_file.save(filepath)
                    passed = True
                except Exception:
                    passed = False
    ...

Restart your app and play around with it. We should now be able to test the
file upload and ensure that the uploaded files now have a randomly generated
three-character alphanumeric name.

## Generating Barcharts with Bokeh

Let's review our requirements again.

### Requirements List

#### Interface
1. [x] Image upload `<form>` page
2. [x] Results page
3. [x] Error page

#### Functionality
1. [x] Upload and store image
2. [x] Serve uploaded image
3. [ ] Predict uploaded image into 8 labels
4. [ ] Display predictions of image in a chart
5. [x] Redirect errors to the error page

We will leave the prediction engine for later, now let's focus on getting the
visual elements working. We should create a mock up of a prediction chart with
placeholder values and once the prediction code is ready we can just feed the
output values to the chart and everything should work.

We will plot charts using Bokeh. Bokeh is full of different functions and nice
tricks to make graphs appear [beautiful and interactive][1] in the web. My aim
is to give you a taste of Bokeh and what it can do. For this tutorial, I will
just use the very basic functions: generating a web-friendly barchart plot.

First and foremost is to install Bokeh into your virtual environment.

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ pip install bokeh==0.12.10
    ... # some output messages

Next, we will need to include some CSS libraries for Bokeh to work on the web
page since we will be generating the graphs from the backend. __Note: Bokeh
needs both CSS and `pip` versions to be identical. If you have version 0.12.10
installed in `pip`, you must use the CSS library version 0.12.10__.

    templates/layout.html
    ===
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=UTF-8">
        <link href="http://cdn.pydata.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-0.12.10.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <link href="http://cdn.pydata.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-widgets-0.12.10.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
        <title>Fuzzy Vision | Upload and Predict Images</title>
    </head>
    ...

Let's use the `/predict/<filename>` route and pass a Bokeh chart object into
it. We'll create a wrapper function so that our route logic is not entangled
with Bokeh generation code. We also need to put in the labels as a global
variable which makes the process of drawing the barcharts a little easier. In
the code:


    server.py
    ===
    ...

    from numpy import pi
    from bokeh.plotting import figure
    from bokeh.embed import components

    ...

    IMAGE_LABELS = ['Headphone', 'Mouse', 'Camera', 'Smartphone',
                    'Glasses', 'Shoes', 'Watch', 'Laptop']

    ...

    def generate_barplot(predictions):

### Bokeh Barchart Generation Explanation

We start by importing the Bokeh functions `figure()` and `components()`. Then,
we create the `IMAGE_LABELS` list which is passed into Bokeh to label the axes
of the figure. We then create the `generate_barplot()` function which takes in
a list of predictions. The function will first create a figure called `plot`
with the `x_range` (think x-axis) values being the image labels and also the
size of the plot (400px by 300px). Then, we plot vertical bars by using the
`plot.vbar()` which takes the x-axis values, the height of each bar as the
argument `top=`, and the width of the bars which we set to 0.8. Since there are
quite a few labels in a small width, we will rotate the x-axis labels by 90
degrees (or $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians). We then return the Bokeh components back
to the calling function. The `components()` function returns a tuple of a
generated JavaScript and the `<div>` elements for the plot.

### Predict Route Update Explanation

On the predict route, we simply run the `generate_barplot()` function with some
placeholder values (for now) and gather the script and div elements. Finally,
we pass the script and div into the template as keyword arguments `plot_script`
and `plot_div`, respectively. Let's add the uploaaded image into the template
too, sometimes you just forget what you uploaded! Last thing to do (before this
works) is to edit `templates/predict.html`.

### Templating the Prediction Page

We need to add some JavaScript to make the plots function and add the template
directives to place the script and div elements where they need to be. Notice
that we use a `{{ * | safe }}` tag to make the HTML render properly and
securely. Lastly, we import some extra JavaScript that will be used by Bokeh
to function properly.

    templates/predict.html
    ===
    {% extends 'layout.html' %}
    {% block body %}
    <p>Our algorithm thinks the following...</p>

    <img src="{{image_url}}" alt="Input image">

    {{ plot_div|safe }}

    <script src="http://cdn.pydata.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-0.12.10.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://cdn.pydata.org/bokeh/release/bokeh-widgets-0.12.10.min.js"></script>
    {{ plot_script|safe }}

    {% endblock %}


If we test the `/predict/<filename>` URL, we should be greeted with a Bokeh
plot. Feel free to play around with the plot controls and understand it. To see
a different graph, just change the decimal values in the `predictions` list
before calling `generate_barplot()`. Note that the values on the graph don't
mean anything as of this moment.

## (Bonus points) Styling the App

The app styling is bland, let's face it. For bonus points, I'll let you decide
on what CSS framework that you would like to use. Up to you to style however
you want. As it is a simple app, feel free to experiment with new frameworks or
just draw something simple up. To add your own CSS, you should use the static
file `static/css/style.css` and link it into the `<head>` of your HTML layout.
Flask has a way of including static files in the templating engine:

    templates/layout.html
    ===
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        ...

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{url_for('static',filename='styles/app.css')}}">

        ...
    </head>
    ...

In the Git repository for this project which I have created, I used a very
lightweight CSS framework by Yahoo! called [Pure CSS][2]. These are the folks
that brought YUI back in the days before TWBS. Good times ;). I also used
[Google Fonts][3] as an easy way to integrate custom fonts into the site. For
reference, here is the homepage I made using the tools I mentioned.

## The Prediction Engine with Keras

Let's begin by installing the packages we need: TensorFlow and Keras. Since
Keras interfaces with TensorFlow on the backend, we will need to install
TensorFlow. However, this is not a trivial process. The [TensorFlow
installation guide][4] has all the information you need to install TensorFlow
on your platform. For the purposes of this tutorial, we will not go down the
rabbit hole of installing GPU or CPU optimized TensorFlow. Instead, we will use
an unoptimized version, which is actually good enough since we are not doing
any model training, only prediction. To load pretrained models, we need the
`h5py` package. Also we will need an extra package to load image files into
`numpy` matrix format; and that is `imageio`.

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ pip install tensorflow==1.3.0
    ... # some output messages

    (fuzzvis) $ pip install Keras==2.1.2
    ... # some output messages

    (fuzzvis) $ pip install h5py==2.7.1
    ... # some output messages

    (fuzzvis) $ pip install imageio==2.2.0
    ... # some output messages

Now, we need to download the pre-trained model file and store it somewhere on
the filesystem. Try not to put it in the same folder as the Fuzzy Vision code
as you might accidentally push the entire model file up to GitHub (or whatever
online code base you use). This might be fine with the model we will be using
in this tutorial but industrial-grade pre-trained models have huge file sizes.

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/syaffers-stuff/models/SouqNet128v2_gpu.h5
    (fuzzvis) $ mkdir -p /tmp/models
    (fuzzvis) $ mv SouqNet128v2_gpu.h5 /tmp/models/

The model was trained on pictures of size 128px by 128px so you will need to
download images of that size for this next part; [Google Images][5] might help,
try and get a JPG image for now. Fire up your Python interpreter; we are
going to play with the model before continuing on with the web application.

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ python
    >>> from keras.models import load_model
    Using TensorFlow backend.

    >>> from imageio import imread

    >>> model = load_model('/home/syafiq/models/SouqNet128v2_gpu.h5')
    ... # some messages which say TensorFlow is not optimized; ignore.

    >>> image = imread('/home/syafiq/Pictures/128s/testmouse1.jpg')
    # use the path to your 128px by 128px image

    >>> image.shape
    (128, 128, 3) # a 3-D tensor, which is expected

I want to pause here for a bit to explain tensors. Tensors are simply a
generalization of a vector into higher orders. A higher order tensor can be
thought of as list of tensors or a preceding order. A single vector is a
first-order tensor (a list of zero-order tensors, which are just numbers), a
matrix is a second-order tensor (list of vectors), and so on. An image has two
spatial dimensions: a width and a height determined by the number of pixels in
the image. This means that it should have lots of columns of pixels, just like
a second-order tensor. So why do we need a third order tensor to represent
images? Well, images have different intensity values for each of the 3 (or 4th
alpha) channels: R, G and B. This means that an image is comprised of 3 layers
of second-order tensors (or matrices). The graphic below should help you
understand the concept.

![F'in tensors, how do they work?](images/tensors.jpg)

Let's continue. We need to reshape the input image so it's a fourth-order
tensor; think of it as a list of third-order tensors. This is how the model was
built to handle inputs during training, it's a technical thing.

    Terminal window
    ===
    >>> image = image / 255.
    >>> model.predict(image.reshape(-1, 128, 128, 3))
    array([[ 0.,  1.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]], dtype=float32)

The division term before the prediction is to normalize the pixels to between
0 and 1 as this is how the model was originally trained. The output you see is
an array of predictions, and the values are probabilities of a particular
label. You can think of it as the confidence that the model has for each label.
There are 8 labels, so there are 8 values in the output; we see one value which
is exactly 1 and the rest are 0s. This means that the model is 100% confident
that the label is "Label #2", which is a computer mouse. The list of labels are
provided in an earlier section: Generating Barcharts with Bokeh. All we need to
do with these values is pass it back to our `generate_barchart()` function and
we will get the distribution of confidence values for each label.

Let's jump back into the server code and load that model into the server. When
the server runs, it loads the model into the backend, ready to predict when
executed. To keep with the security refactoring updates we did earlier, we will
provide the path to the model file in an environment variable.

    server.py
    ===
    ...

    from numpy import pi, squeeze
    from keras.models import load_model
    from imageio import imread

    ...

    NEURAL_NET_MODEL_PATH = os.environ['NEURAL_NET_MODEL_PATH']
    NEURAL_NET = load_model(NEURAL_NET_MODEL_PATH)

    ...

    def load_and_prepare(filepath):
        """ Load and prepares an image data for prediction """
        image_data = imread(filepath)[:, :, :3]
        image_data = image_data / 255.
        image_data = image_data.reshape((-1, 128, 128, 3))
        return image_data

    ...

    @app.route('/predict/<filename>', methods=['GET'])
    def predict(filename):
        image_url = url_for('images', filename=filename)
        image_path = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
        image_data = load_and_prepare(image_path)

        predictions = NEURAL_NET.predict_proba(image_data)
        script, div = generate_barplot(squeeze(predictions))

        return render_template(
            'predict.html',
            plot_script=script,
            plot_div=div,
            image_url=image_url
        )

    ...

We start with some additional imports to introduce the new functions to load
images the model. We then define the `NEURAL_NET_MODEL_PATH` and the actual
`NEURAL_NET` object. The main engine is in the `/predict/<filename>` route.

We then define a `load_and_prepare()` function to load and prepare the images
to be predicted by the Keras model. First we read the image from the filesystem
into  `numpy` matrix. We must do a hack-y trick here while reading the image:
`imread(image_path)[:, :, :3]` to handle PNG images. Usually PNG images have a
fourth channel which is the transparency channel. The model was not trained to
handle this originally and so we have to hack the image reading process by take
only the first three channels and exclude the alpha channel. The image data is
then normalized to between 0 and 1, reshaped, and returned.

In the `/predict/<filename>` route, the prepared image is fed into the neural
network's `predict()` function. If everything goes well, we should get a list
of predictions. Since this list is nested, we use `squeeze()` to flatten the
nesting and pass it to `generate_barplot()`. Don't forget to set the
`NEURAL_NET_MODEL_PATH` as an environment variable:

    Terminal window
    ===
    (fuzzvis) $ export NEURAL_NET_MODEL_PATH='/tmp/models/SouqNet128v2_gpu.h5'

If you run the server now and upload a 128px by 128px image, you should get a
prediction of the image that you uploaded in the barcharts. In a later section
we will look at a basic implementation that will allow us to upload an image of
a non-fixed size. Congratulations, you have now built your own image classifier 
web application! For fun, upload into the classfier an image that is not in any 
of the predefined labels. Here's one I did with a picture of boxes of orange 
juice.

![The model trying to predict orange juice](images/cartons.png)

## Checkpoint! Separating Code Concerns

We've come a long way from scratch. We should reconsider the large bulky
monolithic component that is `server.py`. It contains the server logic for
routing, generating file names, checking allowed file names and generating
barcharts. This is fine for small projects but it doesn't scale to larger
projects as you end up with a single massive file which makes it hard to
navigate through. It also becomes confusing to unit test: should you load the
server just to unit test the random name generator? Clearly not! So let's use
the neglected `utils.py` to sperate the unit functions from the routes. All
we are doing in this section is just moving code around making our workspace
much cleaner.

Let's move all the unnecessary variables and functions from `server.py` into
`utils.py`. The server do not need to know the following variables and
functions:

### Imports

* `import random`, only needed by random name generator.
* `from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename`, see previous reason.
* `from bokeh.plotting import figure`, only needed by barchart generator.
* `from bokeh.embed import components`, see previous reason.
* `from numpy import pi`, see previous reason.
* `from imageio import imread`, only needed by the load and prepare function.

### Variables

* `ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`, this is only used in the renaming function.
* `LETTER_SET`, this is only used in the random name generation function.
* `IMAGE_LABELS`, this is only used by the Bokeh barchart generator.

### Functions

* `generate_random_name()`, the server only calls this function.
* `is_allowed_file()`, see previous reason.
* `generate_barplot()`, see previous reason.
* `load_and_prepare()`, see previous reason.

In `utils.py`:

    utils.py
    ===
    import random
    from bokeh.plotting import figure
    from bokeh.embed import components
    from imageio import imread
    from numpy import pi, squeeze
    from werkzeug.utils import secure_filename

    ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = set(['png', 'bmp', 'jpg', 'jpeg', 'gif'])
    LETTER_SET = list(set('ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789'))
    IMAGE_LABELS = ['Headphone', 'Mouse', 'Camera', 'Smartphone', 'Glasses',
                    'Shoes', 'Watch', 'Laptop']


    def is_allowed_file(filename):
        """ Checks if a filename's extension is acceptable """
        allowed_ext = filename.rsplit('.', 1)[1].lower() in ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS
        return '.' in filename and allowed_ext


    def generate_random_name(filename):
        """ Generate a random name for an uploaded file. """
        ext = filename.split('.')[-1]
        rns = [random.randint(0, len(LETTER_SET) - 1) for _ in range(3)]
        chars = ''.join([LETTER_SET[rn] for rn in rns])

        new_name = "{new_fn}.{ext}".format(new_fn=chars, ext=ext)
        new_name = secure_filename(new_name)

        return new_name


    def load_and_prepare(filepath):
        """ Load and prepares an image data for prediction """
        image_data = imread(filepath)[:, :, :3]
        image_data = image_data / 255.
        image_data = image_data.reshape((-1, 128, 128, 3))
        return image_data


    def generate_barplot(predictions):
        """ Generates script and `div` element of bar plot of predictions using
        Bokeh
        """
        plot = figure(x_range=IMAGE_LABELS, plot_height=300, plot_width=400)
        plot.vbar(x=IMAGE_LABELS, top=predictions, width=0.8)
        plot.xaxis.major_label_orientation = pi / 2.

        return components(plot)


In `server.py`, just modify the imports:

    server.py
    ===
    import os
    from flask import Flask, flash, render_template, redirect, request, send_file, url_for
    from keras.models import load_model
    from numpy import squeeze
    from utils import generate_barplot, generate_random_name, is_allowed_file, load_and_prepare

    ...


Now we have a cleaner server definition with only routes and a utility file
which contaains all the functions that once used to pollute the sever routes.
It is also now easy to unit test the utilities since we only need to import
the functions from `utils.py` to be tested.


## (Bonus section) Accepting Images of Any Size

Everything seems to be working great and you are ready to show it off to your
peers. But, you ask that they upload an image of 128px by 128px which not many
people will have. This is a slight drawback in the implementation of the code
but one that can be remedied with a simple solution: take an image of any size,
resize and crop to fit a box of 128px by 128px and perform prediction on the
resized image.

Unfortunately, images have different focal points and finding the subject of
the image is not trivial. To demonstrate a fairly simple approach, let's just
assume that the subject of an image is located somewhere in the middle of the
image. So the algorithm is roughly as follows:

* if the image is square (i.e. width is equal to height), then just rescale
down to 128px by 128px,
* otherwise, resize the shorter dimension of an image down to 128px, either the
height or the width,
* crop the longer dimension down to 128px while targeting the center of the
image.

Here's an image to show the algorithm at work.

![Rescaling and cropping a wide image to a 128px square](images/rescale.png)

There is a consideration to be made here: what kind of scaling algorithm should 
we use? We have the options of nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic, etc. To 
maintain the image features as we scale down, we will use bicubic scaling. Feel 
free to experiment with [other methods][6].

Let's code that into `utils.py`.

    utils.py
    ===
    from PIL import Image

    ...

    def make_thumbnail(filepath):
        """ Converts input image to 128px by 128px thumbnail if not that size
        and save it back to the source file """
        img = Image.open(filepath)
        thumb = None
        w, h = img.size

        # if it is exactly 128x128, do nothing
        if w == 128 and h == 128:
            return True

        # if the width and height are equal, scale down
        if w == h:
            thumb = img.resize((128, 128), Image.BICUBIC)
            thumb.save(filepath)
            return True

        # when the image's width is smaller than the height
        if w < h:
            # scale so that the width is 128px
            ratio = w / 128.
            w_new, h_new = 128, int(h / ratio)
            thumb = img.resize((w_new, h_new), Image.BICUBIC)

            # crop the excess
            top, bottom = 0, 0
            margin = h_new - 128
            top, bottom = margin // 2, 128 + margin // 2
            box = (0, top, 128, bottom)
            cropped = thumb.crop(box)
            cropped.save(filepath)
            return True

        # when the image's height is smaller than the width
        if h < w:
            # scale so that the height is 128px
            ratio = h / 128.
            w_new, h_new = int(w / ratio), 128
            thumb = img.resize((w_new, h_new), Image.BICUBIC)

            # crop the excess
            left, right = 0, 0
            margin = w_new - 128
            left, right = margin // 2, 128 + margin // 2
            box = (left, 0, right, 128)
            cropped = thumb.crop(box)
            cropped.save(filepath)
            return True
        return False

We should update the server code so that this is done when the image is
uploaded and before it gets predicted.



    server.py
    ===
    import os
    from flask import Flask, flash, render_template, redirect, request, send_file, url_for
    from keras.models import load_model
    from numpy import squeeze
    from utils import generate_barplot, generate_random_name, is_allowed_file, load_and_prepare, make_thumbnail

    ...

    @app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def home():
        ... # truncated part of the function

        # if the file is "legit"
        if image_file:
            passed = False
            try:
                filename = generate_random_name(image_file.filename)
                filepath = os.path.join(app.config['UPLOAD_FOLDER'], filename)
                image_file.save(filepath)
                passed = make_thumbnail(filepath)
            except Exception:
                passed = False

            if passed:
                return redirect(url_for('predict', filename=filename))
            else:
                flash('An error occurred, try again.')
                return redirect(request.url)

    ...

Now if you upload a file of any size, the system should automatically resize
the input image down and crop it to a 128px by 128px thumbnail. This makes the
application much more accessible to users who have non-"standard" size images.

## Ideas for Going Forward

This is a good start into making web applications that use machine learning
tools in the backend. It is still, however, a start. There are many pitfalls
that can make this application not scale into production.

The Keras and TensorFlow installation was unoptimized for the machine making it
relatively slow compared to an optimized TensorFlow installation that makes use
of fast math libraries and C optimizations. When multiple users upload an image 
for prediction, the server can stall and hold users at the upload page (since
it has to complete the resizing and prediction first). This is similarly true
for the image scaling function that we just implemented. By compiling 
TensorFlow from source and using a faster library like `pillow-simd`, this wait
time can be reduced.

There is another way to go about handling this issue. We can implement an 
asynchronous method that defers the heavy lifting of prediction and image
resize to a subprocess without holding back users on the upload page. This way,
when many users decide to use the service simultaneously, the long processing
times can be distributed over several compute cores and the server can render
the prediction page with a loading GIF while it does the processing behind the 
scenes. The uploading and serving of images can also be quickened by using a
cache like Redis via an AWS S3 online bucket.

In production, we should also consider serving the web application on
production-ready server applications like Nginx. This allows the app to focus
on serving the routes and the tasks separately from handling user connections
and other server-related things. We could also collect submitted images and ask
users to click a button to label the images. This could easily be upgraded into
an image labeling application which can be distributed to lots of people for
human labeling. In this case, we will need a database in the back to
persistently store labels.

Bokeh has interactive capabilities on the web which makes it particularly
useful for very complex visualizations. For example, we could add a hover
functionality to show users the actual prediction probabilities. We could also
add a drag-and-drop JavaScript rather than ye olde upload button in the
frontend to make it fancy.

Keras has pre-trained models from many popular image classification works like
VGGNet, ResNet, and MobileNet. These are maybe more suited for general purpose
image classification as it can predict more than the 8 labels that SouqNet was
originally trained on. You will have to make changes to support image sizes and
reducing to only showing the top 10 predicted labels for the barchart but
otherwise, the core functionality is similar.

## Final Words

I hope you have enjoyed creating your own image classification web application.
If you made something awesome, do tweet it to me [@syaffers][8] and I'd be
happy to give a comment or two about it. A similar code structure for this 
tutorial can be found in my GitHub repository called [souqnet-app][9].
